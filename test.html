<p class="center"><p> i haven't been making much music recently. just figured out how to do cool things with my omnichord and a microcosms hologram that i bought because steve marek told me to (shoutout Steve). renamed my music projects to 'summer reading' mostly because hamma time was taken and i want to step away from the cheezing name (long story). picture below takes u to the music page.  </p>
