<p class="center"><p> hi friends. Trying this instead of substack because it's more fun for me? idk.  </p>

<p class="center"><p> here's my recent listening playlist. haven't kept up with it as much as i would have liked to. but that's chill! loving the latest album by friendship.</p>

<p class="center"><p> i haven't been making much music recently. just figured out how to do cool things with my omnichord and a microcosms hologram that i bought because steve marek told me to (shoutout Steve). was blessed by the presence of THE famous mason mann this week who helped me unlock that gosh darn pedal. look out for more beep boops. renamed my music projects to 'summer reading', feelin' like mouse rat w all these name changes.</p>

<p> been reading a lot this month! the highlight of this was the woman destroyed by simone de Beauvoir. Im starting to become interested in learning more about feminist literature and this was a great gateway. the last story in particular was so emotionally gripping I was heartsick the whole time I was reading it. sidenote: I wish I had taken a language art class at some point post 2018 because I feel like all my literary analysis sounds idiotic and immature BUT WHATEVER. at least Im reading :)
