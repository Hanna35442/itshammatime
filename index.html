<p class="center"><p> hi friends. Trying this instead of substack because it's more fun for me? idk.  </p>

<p class="center"><p> here's my recent listening playlist. haven't kept up with it as much as i would have liked to. but that's chill! loving the latest album by friendship.</p>

<p class="center"><p> i haven't been making much music recently. just figured out how to do cool things with my omnichord and a microcosms hologram that i bought because steve marek told me to (shoutout Steve). renamed my music projects to 'summer reading', feelin' like mouse rat w all these name changes.</p>
