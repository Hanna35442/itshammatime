<p class="center"><p> you know that feeling where you see a friend after a year and so much has happened that you feel like it's impossible to catch them up on everything that you want to share? that's me and this blog right now. sorry for not keeping up with it! life gets a little crazy sometimes. i feel like i'm always saying that these days, when isn't life crazy. anyway, i want to do a better job of updating this monthly with projects, goals, musings, etc. </p>
<p so let's see, what's new. /p>
<p> i've been leaning away from music and more into fiber arts - namely knitting and sewing. i love the idea of having a wardrobe that is mostly thrifted and handmade. you can really learn everything from some youtube lessons. 
here's some pictures of the projects i've been working on...</p>

<p class="center"><p> hi hi long time no blog, gonna do some updating soon. </p>
  
  
<p class="center"><h5> july 2 2025 </h5></p>

<p class="center"><p> hi friends. Trying this instead of substack because it's more fun for me? idk.  </p>

<p class="center"><p> here's my recent listening playlist. haven't kept up with it as much as i would have liked to. but that's chill! loving the latest album by friendship.</p>

<p class="center"><p> i haven't been making much music recently. just figured out how to do cool things with my omnichord and a microcosms hologram that i bought because steve marek told me to (shoutout Steve). was blessed by the presence of THE famous mason mann this week who helped me unlock that gosh darn pedal. look out for more beep boops. renamed my music projects to 'summer reading', feelin' like mouse rat w all these name changes.</p>

<p> impulse took the day off work yesterday to go downtown with mason. here's the view from near the planetarium. i forget how purdy the lake is </p>
<p class="center"><img src="water.png" width="161" height="195" alt="water" /></p>

<p> been reading a lot this month! the highlight of this was the woman destroyed by simone de Beauvoir. Im starting to become interested in learning more about feminist literature and this was a great gateway. the last story in particular was so emotionally gripping I was heartsick the whole time I was reading it. sidenote: I wish I had taken a language art class at some point post 2018 because I feel like all my literary analysis sounds idiotic and immature BUT WHATEVER. at least Im reading :)
